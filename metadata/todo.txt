ToDo Plan:
	- Rework level gui to make it pretty
	- Make plaed bombs dragable
	- maybe give them ui when clicked on to say detonate or pick up if clicked on

URGENT:
	- Bombs can be detonated in mid air

Implimentation Flaws:
	- Bombs can be placed where a crate is
	- Lava should have a higher z value than the player 

To Add Features:
	- Change level menu level button if the level is done "perfectly" fewest bombs possible
	- Make some sort of indicator icon that can be used to give players hints as to where bombs should be placed
