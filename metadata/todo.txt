Must Do:
	- Make levels 5 -21
	- Add plant decorations
	- Write big bad shader code for ore layer :(

Funny ideas:
	- Customized loading screen

Currently being thought about:
	- Player Guidance
	- Adding rigid body in lava to prevent player sinkiing
	- Redraw sprites for level boxes
	- Consider thinking more about the current gui font colors (white is lame)
