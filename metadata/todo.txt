Must Do:
	- Make levels 10 -21
	- Make home screen buttons less ugly

Bugs:
	- If timmed right the player can jump and die in lava due to cayote time
	- Ask Kyle for help why crates are like 15 px as collider

Currently being thought about:
	- Customized loading screen
	- Make title pretty somehow
		- Use a .ttf in asseprite
	- Redraw bomb textures
	- Think about the ffloating chest issue
		- Hard stone? act a gui tile? physics?
	- Make sounds better by adding slight varation to each one
