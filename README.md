# Puzzle-Game

I created a puzzle game, named Terra Bomber, using the Godot game engine. The game hinges on the idea of destructible puzzles, where levels consist of bombs that players must strategically detonate to clear a path to the goal (a chest). In later levels I was able to build on my foundational mechanics in a modular way that allowed me to implement new ideas such as bomb upgrades and bomb resistant blocks. This project came out much more functional and polished than I was expecting, but I nonetheless think game development is not something I will pursue further. 

As mentioned, Terra Bomber was the result of my learnings about the world of game development. The development process facilitated me with learning how to design 2D art with tools like Aesprite, writing code in Godot’s native language, GDscript, and how to effectively structure a project of this size. I also got a lot of invaluable experience with git and managing branches so I could effectively work on new content while maintaining a production branch.

A runable instance of this game can be found on [itch.io](https://null0fish.itch.io/terra-bomber)
