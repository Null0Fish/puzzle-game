# Puzzle-Game

I created a puzzle game, named Terra Bomber, using the Godot game engine. Terra Bomber hinges on the idea of destructible puzzles, where levels consist of bombs that must be strategically detonated to clear a path to the goal (a chest). In later levels, I was able to build on the foundational mechanics in a modular way that allowed me to implement new ideas such as bomb upgrades and bomb-resistant blocks. I was pleased that this project came out much more functional and polished than I was expecting.

Terra Bomber was the result of my learnings about the world of game development. To facilitate the development process, I learned how to design 2D art with tools like Aesprite, writing code in Godot’s native language, GDscript, and how to effectively structure a project of this size. I also acquired invaluable experience with git and managing branches that enabled me to effectively work on new content while maintaining a production branch.

A runable instance of this game can be found on [itch.io](https://null0fish.itch.io/terra-bomber)
